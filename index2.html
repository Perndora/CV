      <!NOTE:>
      <! I am starting with creating a website with only html attributes, e.g John Kleinberg Webpage>
      <! I start by naming the title of my page>

    <title> LESSON NOTE FOR HTML</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <!NOTE:>
    <! The first thing to begin with is the large header tag(h1) to write my name>
    <h1>Kingsley Onyeka</h1>

    <! Next is to paragraph text using the (p) tag>
    <! The paragraph text in john's website are italisized. We can actually do this in two ways:>
    <! No.1; using the italics "i" tag: this is used to italisize a text without adding any importance to the statement>
    <! No.2; using the emphatic "em" tag: this tag also italisizes text but adds emphasies on the text >
    <! So preferrable we use the "em" tag since it also attaches importance>
    <p> <em> Student of Biochemistry,<strong> University of Nigeria, Nsukka.</strong></em> </p>
    <p>I am a student of Web development and and Machine Learning, I hope to make web site creation quality and affordable</p>

    <! Another pair of tags that are similar is the bold "b" tag and the strong "strong tag>
    <! The  bold tag makes the text bold while the strong tag makes it bold and identifies it as important.>

    <! IMAGE TAG>
    <!The image tag is used for inserting an image into the html doc, it has a source("src") atribute >
    <! This src atribute helps in locating the source of image i.e; the file location of the image. >
    <!This file location can be a web address of the image OR can be inserted on the same folder of the html doc>
    <!Also the image might be on another folder but will require adding the file location path to the name of the image.  >
    <!The alternative name ("alt") attribute shows the name to be shown when the image is unable to load may be due to lack of mobile data.>
    <! The image can be resized using the width and height specification>
    <img src="somtochukwu.png"  width="300" height="300" alt=" Somtochukwu Profile Picture">

    <! THE HORIZONTAL LINE (hr) tag>
    <! This used to create a horizontal line in order to demacate and beautify the website>
    <! The hr tag is a self closing tag>
    <hr>

    <! LIST>
    <! There are two types of lists: Ordered and Unordered list>
    <!Ordered List(ol) tag: this is used in creating a numbered list>
    <!Unordered List(ul) tag: this is used in creating a list that is not numbered>
    <!Examples below>
